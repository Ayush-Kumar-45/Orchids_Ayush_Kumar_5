      "question": "Which molecule has a bond order of zero and does not exist under normal conditions?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "He₂",
        "b": "H₂",
        "c": "Li₂",
        "d": "B₂"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Correct. He₂ has a bond order of zero, making it unstable and non-existent under normal conditions.",
        "b": "Incorrect. H₂ has a bond order of 1 and is stable.",
        "c": "Incorrect. Li₂ has a bond order of 1 and can exist.",
        "d": "Incorrect. B₂ has a bond order of 1 and is known to exist."

      "question": "In the molecular orbital diagram, antibonding orbitals are represented by:",
      "answers": {
        "a": "No symbol",
        "b": "A single line",
        "c": "An asterisk (*)",
        "d": "A plus (+) sign"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. Antibonding orbitals must be identified.",
        "b": "Incorrect. A single line represents an orbital, not its type.",
        "c": "Correct. Antibonding orbitals are denoted by an asterisk (*).",
        "d": "Incorrect. '+' is not a conventional symbol for antibonding orbitals."

      "question": "Which of the following diatomic species is paramagnetic?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "N₂",
        "b": "O₂⁻",
        "c": "CO",
        "d": "F₂"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. N₂ has all paired electrons.",
        "b": "Correct. O₂⁻ has one unpaired electron in a π* orbital, making it paramagnetic.",
        "c": "Incorrect. CO has all paired electrons.",
        "d": "Incorrect. F₂ is diamagnetic with no unpaired electrons."

      "question": "The energy gap between bonding and antibonding orbitals is greatest for which of the following?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "H₂",
        "b": "O₂",
        "c": "He₂",
        "d": "N₂"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Correct. H₂ has the largest energy separation between σ1s and σ*1s orbitals due to the small size and high bonding-antibonding difference.",
        "b": "Incorrect. O₂ has smaller energy gaps compared to H₂.",
        "c": "Incorrect. He₂ does not have a large energy gap; its bond order is zero.",
        "d": "Incorrect. N₂ has a moderate energy gap, not the greatest."
