 ## MOLECULAR ORBITAL SIMULATOR (For Homonuclear & Heteronuclear Diatomic Molecules)<br>

****Basic Principles****<br>

Molecular orbital (MO) theory describes the behavior of electrons in molecules in terms of combinations of atomic orbitals. When atoms bond to form molecules, their atomic orbitals combine to form molecular orbitals that are spread over the entire molecule.


****Features:-**** <br>

1.Bonding Orbitals: Lower in energy than the original atomic orbitals, promote bonding.<br>
2. Antibonding Orbitals: Higher in energy than the original atomic orbitals, denoted with a*.
3. Sigma (σ) Bonds: Formed by head-on overlapping of orbitals.
4. Pi (π) Bonds: Formed by side-by-side overlapping of p orbitals.
5. Bond Order: (Number of bonding electrons - Number of antibonding electrons) / 2.<br>

****Orbital Ordering:**** <br>

The relative energy ordering of molecular orbitals changes across the periodic table:

1. For Z < 8 (Before Oxygen): σ(2s) < σ*(2s) < π(2px) = π(2py) < σ(2pz) < π*(2px) = π*(2py) < σ*(2pz)
2. For Z ≥ 8 (Oxygen and beyond): σ(2s) < σ*(2s) < σ(2pz) < π(2px) = π(2py) < π*(2px) = π*(2py) < σ*(2pz)<br>

****Magnetic Properties:**** <br>
Molecules with unpaired electrons are paramagnetic (attracted to magnetic fields), while those with all electrons paired are diamagnetic (slightly repelled by magnetic fields).

---
****Practical Applications:**** <br>

Molecular orbital theory helps explain:

1. Why O₂ is paramagnetic despite having an even number of electrons.
2. The relative bond strengths in diatomic molecules.
3. Electronic transitions in spectroscopy.
4. Conductivity in metals and semiconductors.
