      "question": "Which of the following is true about bonding molecular orbitals?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "They result from destructive interference of atomic orbitals",
        "b": "They have higher energy than the original atomic orbitals",
        "c": "They increase electron density between the nuclei",
        "d": "They always contain paired electrons"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. Destructive interference forms antibonding orbitals.",
        "b": "Incorrect. Bonding orbitals have lower energy.",
        "c": "Correct. Bonding orbitals increase electron density between the nuclei, stabilizing the molecule.",
        "d": "Incorrect. Bonding orbitals can have unpaired electrons depending on electron configuration."

      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. σ(1s) is a low-energy bonding orbital.",
        "b": "Incorrect. σ*(1s) is higher than σ(1s) but lower than σ*(2p).",

      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. This is the bond order of O₂, not N₂.",
        "b": "Incorrect. 2.5 would suggest fractional bonding not applicable to N₂.",
        "c": "Correct. N₂ has a bond order of 3, indicating a strong triple bond.",

      "question": "Which of the following statements is true for heteronuclear diatomic molecules?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "All atomic orbitals mix equally",
        "b": "The more electronegative atom contributes more to bonding orbitals",
        "c": "Bond order is always an integer",
        "d": "There is no mixing of orbitals from different atoms"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. Orbital mixing depends on energy compatibility.",
        "b": "Correct. The more electronegative atom contributes more to bonding MOs.",
        "c": "Incorrect. Bond orders can be fractional in heteronuclear molecules.",
        "d": "Incorrect. Orbital mixing is fundamental to MO theory."
